#### Project Description

The Nobel Prize is awarded yearly to scientists and scholars in chemistry, literature, physics, medicine, economics, and peace, with the first prize awarded in 1901. Are there any biases in the way the honors are awarded? Use your data manipulation and visualization skills to explore the history of this coveted prize.

#### Project Instructions

#### Analyze Nobel Prize winner data and identify patterns by answering the following questions:

##### What is the most commonly awarded gender and birth country?

Store your answers as string variables top_gender and top_country.

##### Which decade had the highest ratio of US-born Nobel Prize winners to total winners in all categories?

Store this as an integer called max_decade_usa.

##### Which decade and Nobel Prize category combination had the highest proportion of female laureates?

Store this as a dictionary called max_female_dict where the decade is the key and the category is the value. There should only be one key:value pair.

##### Who was the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize, and in what category?

Save your string answers as first_woman_name and first_woman_category.

##### Which individuals or organizations have won more than one Nobel Prize throughout the years?

Store the full names in a list named repeat_list.
