##### Explore the __crimes.csv__ dataset and use your findings to answer the following questions:

- Which hour has the highest frequency of crimes? Store as an integer variable called peak_crime_hour.
- Which area has the largest frequency of night crimes (crimes committed between 10pm and 3:59am)? Save as a  string variable called peak_night_crime_location.
- Identify the number of crimes committed against victims of different age groups. Save as a pandas Series called victim_ages, with age group labels "0-17", "18-25", "26-34", "35-44", "45-54", "55-64", and "65+" as the index and the frequency of crimes as the values.
